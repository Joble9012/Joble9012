**📝 Project Overview**  
This project dives into my personal Spotify listening history to see what my music habits really look like—what I listen to most, when I listen, and how those patterns change over time.  

I downloaded my full Spotify history as multiple JSON files, each packed with details like timestamps, track and artist names, and play duration in milliseconds. My first step was to pull everything together into one clean CSV file. Along the way, I removed extra columns I didn’t need (platform details, IP addresses, audiobook fields), filtered out odd outliers (like the *“White Noise 3 Hour Long”* track), formatted dates, converted milliseconds to minutes, and kept only plays from 2018 onward.  

After cleaning, I analyzed the data using **pandas** — identifying top artists, most-played songs, and total listening hours. Finally, I visualized key insights using **Tableau** dashboards.


**🧩 Findings**  
1. **🎧 Lowest Listening Day:** Sundays had the least listening time, likely due to family, church, and errands.  
2. **👨‍🎤 Consistent Top Artists:** *Post Malone* and *Juice WRLD* consistently appear among top artists and songs over the years.  
3. **⏰ Peak Listening Time:** Around **3:00 PM**, possibly tied to afternoon energy or work sessions.  
4. **📆 Monthly Patterns:** No single “highest” month — habits vary yearly.
