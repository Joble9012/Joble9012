# 👋 Hi there, I'm Joble!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I love making things work better — cleaner, simpler, and with purpose.

Whether I’m building a dashboard, writing SQL queries, or organizing a messy dataset, I’m driven by curiosity and the goal of turning information into insight.

With experience spanning IT, research, and healthcare analytics, I’ve seen how data becomes powerful when people can feel what it means.

I’m now looking to grow as a Data Analyst — collaborating with others, uncovering patterns, and telling meaningful stories through data.
