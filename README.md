### Overview & Objective
Music has always been woven into my daily routine‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm on my way to school, studying, working out, or just relaxing. Over the years, Spotify has become a constant companion, silently collecting data about my listening habits. This project explores that history to uncover what my music says about me‚Äîwhat artists and genres dominate my playlists, when I tend to listen the most, and how my habits have evolved over time.

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize my personal Spotify listening history to gain deeper insight into my listening behavior. By transforming raw Spotify streaming data into meaningful metrics, I aimed to answer questions like:
Which artists and songs have defined different periods of my life?
What time of day or week do I listen most frequently?
How have my preferences shifted over the years?

Ultimately, this project combines data analysis and storytelling‚Äîturning years of streaming history into a visual reflection of my music journey.



### What I Did

I downloaded my full Spotify history as multiple JSON files containing timestamps, track and artist names, and play durations in milliseconds. The first step was consolidating all data into a clean CSV file. During cleaning using Python, I:  
- Removed unnecessary columns (platform details, IP addresses, audiobook fields)  
- Filtered out outliers (e.g., *‚ÄúWhite Noise 3 Hour Long‚Äù*)  
- Formatted dates and converted milliseconds to minutes  
- Retained plays from 2018 onward only  

After cleaning, I analyzed the data using **Python pandas** to identify top artists, most-played songs, and total listening hours. Visualizations were created with **Tableau** dashboards.


### Key Findings
1. **Lowest Listening Day:** Sundays had the least listening time (family, church, errands).  
2. **Consistent Top Artists:** *Post Malone* and *Juice WRLD* appear consistently over the years.  
3. **Peak Listening Time:** Around **3:00 PM**, likely tied to afternoon activity or work sessions.  
4. **Monthly Patterns:** No single ‚Äúhighest‚Äù month ‚Äî habits vary yearly.

### Reflection
Working with Spotify‚Äôs data presented a few unexpected challenges. The raw JSON files were large, inconsistent, and split across multiple exports, which made data consolidation and cleaning the most time-consuming step. I had to carefully parse timestamps, remove duplicate entries, and convert milliseconds to meaningful units like minutes and hours.
Another challenge was handling incomplete or misleading data, such as songs with extremely short play durations or non-music content (like white noise or podcasts). Designing filters to exclude these outliers was key to keeping the analysis accurate.

On the visualization side, learning to effectively use Tableau to tell a clear story through charts and dashboards pushed me to think critically about data presentation‚Äîhow to highlight patterns without cluttering the view.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization, while also gaining a new appreciation for how much data can reveal about personal habits. Beyond the technical side, it was fascinating to see my music taste evolve and connect those trends to different stages of my life.

## Random Artist Generator

[View Source Code](https://github.com/Joble9012/RandomArtistGenerator)  

### Overview & Objective
I noticed I kept listening to the same songs repeatedly. To break the routine and discover new artists, I created the **Random Artist Generator**, a Python application that uses the **Spotify Web API** to suggest artists, show details, and save them in a local database.

### What I Did

- **Random Artist Generation:** Pulls a random artist from Spotify above a set popularity score  
- **Artist Details:** Displays artist name, popularity, genres, and clickable Spotify link  
- **Database Storage:** Saves discovered artists in a local SQLite database  
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Ensures no repeated artists  
- **View All Artists:** Lists all saved artists with details  
- **Clear Database:** Wipes stored artists easily

How It Works
1. **Spotify API Connection:** Uses Spotipy with your Spotify API credentials  
2. **Random Search:** Selects a random letter, fetches 50 artists, filters by popularity  
3. **Display & Save:** Shows artist details and saves to `artists.db`  
4. **Avoid Repeats:** Skips artists already stored

### Reflection
This project is still in its early stages, and I‚Äôm excited to expand its capabilities.  

Upcoming ideas include:  
- [ ] Genre filter with checkboxes to discover artists from specific styles  
- [ ] Album randomizer mode  
- [ ] Improved and more polished UI  
- [ ] Mobile-friendly version  
- [ ] Integration with my Spotify listening history to make personalized suggestions
