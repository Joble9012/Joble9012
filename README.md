### Overview & Objective
Music has always been woven into my daily routine‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm on my way to school, studying, working out, or just relaxing. Over the years, Spotify has become a constant companion, silently collecting data about my listening habits. This project explores that history to uncover what my music says about me‚Äîwhat artists and genres dominate my playlists, when I tend to listen the most, and how my habits have evolved over time.

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize my personal Spotify listening history to gain deeper insight into my listening behavior. By transforming raw Spotify streaming data into meaningful metrics, I aimed to answer questions like:
Which artists and songs have defined different periods of my life?
What time of day or week do I listen most frequently?
How have my preferences shifted over the years?

Ultimately, this project combines data analysis and storytelling‚Äîturning years of streaming history into a visual reflection of my music journey.



### What I Did
To start, I requested my Spotify listening history through their data request feature. A few days later, I received around ten separate JSON files containing roughly 900,000 streaming records.

I began by exploring the structure of the files‚Äîexamining column names, checking sample entries, and understanding what each field represented. Then, using Python and pandas, I cleaned and consolidated the data into a single CSV file. This involved:
- Merging all JSON files into one dataset
- Removing unnecessary columns (e.g., IP addresses, platform details, audiobook fields)
- Filtering out outliers like ambient noise tracks (e.g., ‚ÄúWhite Noise 3 Hour Long‚Äù)
- Formatting timestamps and converting milliseconds to minutes
- Keeping only data from 2018 onward to ensure consistency

Once the data was cleaned, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights. Using Python, I identified metrics such as top artists, top tracks, total listening time, and yearly listening distribution.

After completing the analysis, I imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau to design interactive dashboards. I created two main dashboards:
Listening Over Time ‚Äì focused on trends by day, month, and year
Artists & Songs ‚Äì highlighting my most-played artists and tracks

In designing the visualizations, my goal was to balance insight and simplicity‚Äîshowing the most meaningful patterns without overwhelming the viewer. I styled the dashboards to resemble Spotify‚Äôs clean UI aesthetic, and experimented with filters that allow exploration by year and month.


### Key Findings
1. **Lowest Listening Day:** Sundays had the least listening time (family, church, errands).  
2. **Consistent Top Artists:** *Post Malone* and *Juice WRLD* appear consistently over the years.  
3. **Peak Listening Time:** Around **3:00 PM**, likely tied to afternoon activity or work sessions.  
4. **Monthly Patterns:** No single ‚Äúhighest‚Äù month ‚Äî habits vary yearly.

### Reflection
Working with Spotify‚Äôs data presented a few unexpected challenges. The raw JSON files were large, inconsistent, and split across multiple exports, which made data consolidation and cleaning the most time-consuming step. I had to carefully parse timestamps, remove duplicate entries, and convert milliseconds to meaningful units like minutes and hours.
Another challenge was handling incomplete or misleading data, such as songs with extremely short play durations or non-music content (like white noise or podcasts). Designing filters to exclude these outliers was key to keeping the analysis accurate.

On the visualization side, learning to effectively use Tableau to tell a clear story through charts and dashboards pushed me to think critically about data presentation‚Äîhow to highlight patterns without cluttering the view.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization, while also gaining a new appreciation for how much data can reveal about personal habits. Beyond the technical side, it was fascinating to see my music taste evolve and connect those trends to different stages of my life.

## Random Artist Generator

[View Source Code](https://github.com/Joble9012/RandomArtistGenerator)  

### Overview & Objective
I noticed I kept listening to the same songs repeatedly. To break the routine and discover new artists, I created the **Random Artist Generator**, a Python application that uses the **Spotify Web API** to suggest artists, show details, and save them in a local database.

### What I Did

- **Random Artist Generation:** Pulls a random artist from Spotify above a set popularity score  
- **Artist Details:** Displays artist name, popularity, genres, and clickable Spotify link  
- **Database Storage:** Saves discovered artists in a local SQLite database  
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Ensures no repeated artists  
- **View All Artists:** Lists all saved artists with details  
- **Clear Database:** Wipes stored artists easily

How It Works
1. **Spotify API Connection:** Uses Spotipy with your Spotify API credentials  
2. **Random Search:** Selects a random letter, fetches 50 artists, filters by popularity  
3. **Display & Save:** Shows artist details and saves to `artists.db`  
4. **Avoid Repeats:** Skips artists already stored

### Reflection
This project is still in its early stages, and I‚Äôm excited to expand its capabilities.  

Upcoming ideas include:  
- [ ] Genre filter with checkboxes to discover artists from specific styles  
- [ ] Album randomizer mode  
- [ ] Improved and more polished UI  
- [ ] Mobile-friendly version  
- [ ] Integration with my Spotify listening history to make personalized suggestions
